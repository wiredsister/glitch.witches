# Code of Conduct: Glitch.Witches() Github Open Source Community Manifesto

## Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

    Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
    Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
    Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
    Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

    Unwanted sexual interactions with colleagues and having any sexual relations with a subbordinate
    Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    Public or private harassment
    Disruptive behavior
    Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community moderators (@Weird Sister [Mod], 698646755063103614) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces, and which have a negative impact on community health.


Enforcement and Reporting

We encourage all sub-communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at info.glitch.witches@gmail.com.

Your report will be handled in accordance with the issue resolution process described in the Code of Conduct FAQ. All project and community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We reserve the right to keep and document notes on your member disciplinary behavior in the case of future ban appeals.
